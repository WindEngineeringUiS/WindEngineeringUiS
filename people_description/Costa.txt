I am currently an engineer at NPRA. I was PhD candidate at the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science, at the University of Stavanger (UiS), between September 2019 and November 2022.
I got my master's degree at TÃ©cnico Lisboa in 2013. I have worked as a structural engineer in Portugal and Norway, both on the consultant and the client side, with buildings, bridges and floating bridges. 
My research interests are related to the dynamic response of floating bridges, estimation of wind and wave loads, parametric instabilities and bridge deck aerodynamics and optimization.
