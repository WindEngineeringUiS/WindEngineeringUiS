I am currently a consultant at Svend Ole Hansen ApS. I was a PhD candidate at the Department of Mechanical and Structural Engineering and Materials Science of University of Stavanger (UiS) between May 2018 and April 2022. I got my Master's Degree at Politecnico di Milano and completed the thesis work in the Polimi Wind Tunnel. My research interests are bridge deck aerodynamics, structural dynamics and full-scale monitoring of turbulence.
