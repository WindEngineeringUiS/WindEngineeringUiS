My name is Mohammad Nafisifard, currently a final year PhD student in structural engineering at the University of Stavanger and an early stage researcher in the Mari Sklodowska-Curie Action: Lidar knowledge Europe (LIKE) project. I have a Master's degree in Earthquake Engineering from University of Tehran, Iran.  I would like to work on subjects around infrastructure and sustainable development. Structural Engineering (as my M.Sc. and Ph.D.) and Wind data analysis (as my PhD dissertation) are two of the topics that interest me a lot and I have already had sound and profound theory knowledge on these alongside some working experience.
